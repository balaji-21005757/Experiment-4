# Experiment-4
# AIM :
To write a java program to print the even numbers between 1 - 20
# ALGORITHM :
1. Open a project in Intelij or any other online java program runner platform
2. Create a class
3. Create a for loop 
4. Initialzie the first value as 1 and condition less than or equal to 20
5. Using if condition statement get the even numbers 
6. Run the program to print the even numbers

        int i;
        for(i=1;i<=20;i++)
        {
            if(i%2==0)
            {
                System.out.println(i);
            }
        }
    }
